### Experience
```
I got my first development experience at the university when 
I entered the group of students on the development of an electronic document management system. 
The system was based on Apache Struts, with PostgresSQL database. My main responsibility was to create triggers, stored procedures, and action classes.

After graduating from university, I spent less than a year working in a small company as a system administrator.
And after that I found a job as a java developer. The first half of the year I worked on the bug fix and additions to the Android UI. 
Further worked in the new enterprise project (logistics system), based on stack Maven/ Spring MVC/ Security/ RMI/ LDAP/ Hibernate with DB2, and UI on GWT/SMART/Sencha GXT.

This year I took part in the development of Spring / JPA Enterprise application with authorization and role-based access rights.
on the Maven / Spring MVC / Security / REST (Jackson) / Java 8 Stream API stack:
   - implementation of saving to the Postgres and HSQLDB bases on Spring JBDC, JPA (Hibernate) and Spring-Data-JPA
   - implementation and testing of REST and AJAX controllers
   - client implementation on Bootstrap (css / js), datatables, jQuery + plugins.
